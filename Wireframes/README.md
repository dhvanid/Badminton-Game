I have created wireframes using Balsamiq Tool. 
The wireframes are connected to each other and I have added links in the buttons for the connections.
You can find the link to the working copy of wireframes as follows : <a href="/working_mock/Badminton Game.pdf">Badminton Game</a>.

Note : You need to download the pdf in order to access the button click events.
